# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
Built an advanced ML model to predict cardiovascular disease using health data. Applied feature engineering (BMI, BP categories), handled class imbalance, and used XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated with ROC AUC, PR curve, SHAP explainability, and saved the model for deployment.
